Michael,

I have finally completed the "reincarnation" of the 16 bit OS/2 serial device
driver.  I haven't done much testing yet.  This version should work for any
machine that can run OS/2 1.x. (including 286s)

Please note the explnation for the "i" keyword in DDRIVER.TXT.  You may need 
to adjust this value.

Please let me know if you have ANY trouble; either via e-mail 
(emmett@os-tools.com) or by leaving a message addressed to me or the SysOp on 
the BBS.

I'll be looking forward to hearing your feed back.  If I discover any problems
during the testing I will inform you and make any fixes availble to you as 
soon as they are complete.

Thanks for your interest, and patience.

Emmett
