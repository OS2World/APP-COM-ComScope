                         COM/8 Asynchronous Device Driver
                        Information and Installation Guide

     Introduction

          The OS/tools Incorporated COM/8 Device Driver for OS/2 is capable of
          handling up to eight asynchronous serial devices for each COM/8
          "DEVICE=" line in the CONFIG.SYS file.  It can either replace or
          supplement either the COM01.SYS asynchronous device driver supplied
          by IBM and Microsoft for use with Industry Standard Architecture
          (ISA) machines, the COM02.SYS device driver supplied by IBM and
          Microsoft for use with Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) machines and
          versions 1.x of OS/2.  The COM/8 device can also replace and/or
          supplement the COM.SYS device driver supplied with OS/2 2.0.

     Version Description

          There are three different versions of the COM/8 device driver:

               1.   A standard version, COMDD.SYS, that will work with any IBM
                    compatible Asynchronous Serial port and/or adapter board.

               2.   Custom versions, xCOMDD.SYS, that will only work with
                    specific adapter boards.  Where the "x" varies with the
                    adapter board the custom COM/8 device driver is optimized
                    for.  These versions are usually distributed by the OEM
                    suppliers of specific adapter boards.

               3.   An evaluation version, COMDDE.SYS, will work on any IBM
                    compatible Asynchronous Serial port or adapter board, but
                    has some features disabled.  See Evaluation Device Driver
                    Restrictions under Application Interface, below.

     Systems Supported

     The COM/8 device driver supports two of the three platforms that support
     the OS/2 operating system.  The two platforms supported are the Industry
     Standard Architecture (ISA), or IBM AT bus, and the Micro Channel
     Architecture (MCA) bus.  Specific support for the Extended Industry
     Architecture (EISA) is expected by January of 1993.


     Micro Channel Architecture Support

          The COM/8 device driver will automatically configure a Micro Channel
          Architecture machine with asynchronous serial ports that use base
          I/O addresses and interrupt levels the same as those specified by
          IBM for MCA machines.  The I/O base addresses and interrupt levels
          for Asynchronous Serial Devices supported for automatic
          configuration by the COM/8 device driver are:



             Base I/O address      Logical Port      Interrupt Level

             3F8h                  One               4

             2F8h                  Two               3
             3220h                 Three             3
             3228h                 Four              3
             4220h                 Five              3
             4228h                 Six               3
             5220h                 Seven             3
             5228h                 Eight             3

          If the device driver finds a valid Asynchronous Serial device at one
          of the above I/O base addresses that is connected to the
          corresponding interrupt level, then that device is initialized and
          made available to applications.  Unlike the COM02.SYS or COM.SYS
          device drivers supplied with OS/2 (for use with MCA machines), the
          COM/8 device driver is designed to have a one-to-one relationship
          with available port base addresses and DOS device names.  This means
          that a DOS device name (e.g. COM1) will be mapped directly to a
          corresponding hardware address (e.g. logical port one).  Ports will
          be mapped as shown below.

               Logical Port       DOS Device Name

               One                COM1
               Two                COM2
               Three              COM3

               Four               COM4
               Five               COM5
               Six                COM6
               Seven              COM7
               Eight              COM8

          If you install devices that fill address space for port's one,
          three, and four, then DOS devices COM1, COM3, and COM4 will be
          available to applications after automatic configuration at system
          start-up (boot).

          If you need consecutive DOS device name numbering, you must
          configure your hardware for consecutive base addresses as described
          above, or specify the pertinent information about your hardware on
          the  COM/8 device driver command line (see explanation under device
          driver installation).

     Industry Standard Architecture Support


          There is no automatic configuration for Industry Standard
          Architecture (ISA) machines.  Because ISA machines use edge
          sensitive interrupts, there are restrictions the COM/8 device driver
          must place on port address and interrupt level selection.

          In an ISA machine, devices that have the same interrupt level must
          be on the same expansion board (all in one slot).  A maximum of
          eight devices can be handled by the COM/8 device driver on any
          single interrupt level on ISA machines.  The  COM/8 device driver
          will not prevent you from using the same interrupt level across
          slots.

     Hardware Requirements

          It is highly recommended that any asynchronous serial device used
          with OS/2 have hardware buffering capabilities (i.e. using the
          16550A UART).  This is especially important when more than two or
          three devices are to be supported and/or baud rates above 1200 bps
          are to be used.  The  COM/8 device driver will not prevent you from
          using non-hardware-buffered devices.

          The COM/8 device driver will perform the following tests at
          initialization to verify that any device it is expected to support
          is configured correctly:

               1.   Test if there is a valid UART at the requested I/O base
                    address.

               2.   Test if the requested interrupt level is available.

               3.   Test if the device is connected to the requested interrupt
                    level.

          Any discrepancies in the above tests are reported during
          initialization at start-up.  Devices that fail the above tests will
          not be installed and will not, therefore, be available to
          applications through this device driver load.

     Device Driver Installation

          Standard Version

               If you have the standard version of the device driver you must
               use the installation program (INSTALL.EXE) supplied on the
               distribution disk.

               Place your distribution disk in either drive A or drive B and
               change the default drive to that drive (e.g. [C:\]A: <ENTER>).
               Enter INSTALL at the prompt, followed by the drive and
               directory path where you want to install the driver (e.g.
               [A:\]INSTALL c:\os2 <ENTER>).

               You will be prompted for a configuration string during the
               installation process.  Be sure you are familiar with your
               hardware configuration and what you will need to place in the
               configuration string, based on that hardware configuration.
               See Device Driver Configuration below for details on how to
               assemble a configuration string.  A "DEVICE=COMDD.SYS
               'configuration string'" line will be written, automatically,
               into your CONFIG.SYS file by the installation program.


          Multiple License, Custom, and Evaluation Versions

               If you are installing a multiply licensed, custom (OEM) version
               (xCOMDD.SYS), or the evaluation version (COMDDE.SYS) of the
               device driver then copy the device driver from the distribution
               disk to a directory on your boot disk and add this line to your
               CONFIG.SYS file:

                    DEVICE=[path][driver name] [configuration switches]

                    Where "path" is the absolute directory path you copied the
                    device driver to and "driver name" is either COMDDS.SYS,
                    COMDDE.SYS, or xCOMDD.SYS, where "x" is dependent on which
                    OEM the device driver is customized for.

               Includes Rev's E, Em, Q, Qm, N, Nm, S, and Sm.

     Device Driver Configuration

          If you have non-standard hardware, with different base addresses or
          different interrupt levels than those supported for automatic
          configuration, or more than eight devices on an MCA machine, or you
          have an ISA machine, you will have to define the device driver
          configuration with command line switches.

          All switches begin with "/" or "-".  The first character after the
          "/" or "-" will be a "V", a number from "1" to "8", an "I", a "P",
          an "M", a "T", a "C", or a "D".

          A "V" following a "/" enables verbose mode and tells the driver to
          write to the screen, at start-up time, the base I/O address,
          interrupt level, and non default buffer sizes for each logical
          device the driver controls.  A "D" following the "V" will cause the
          device driver to delay after writing the "verbose" information to
          the screen.  If a number follows the "D", it will be used to
          determine the time (in tenths of a second) to delay after all
          devices to be supported are initialized.  The default delay value is
          20 (2 seconds).  The "V" switch also causes device driver version
          information to be displayed during initialization.

          A number "1" through "8" following a "/" represents the specific
          logical device number subsequent characters in the switch refer to.
          A"1" following the "/" would refer to the first logical device.
          There are up to eight logical devices for each COM/8 "DEVICE=" line
          in the CONFIG.SYS file.  After the "number" the following characters
          have meaning:

               "I"  Tells the driver that the following number is the
                    interrupt level to use for this logical device.  All
                    interrupt levels except 0 and 1 are supported.

               "P"  Tells the driver that the following number is the base I/O
                    address of this logical device.

               "M"  Precedes a buffer size specification for this logical
                    device; an "MR" indicates a read buffer size follows, an
                    "MW" indicates a write buffer size follows, and an "MI"
                    indicates a COMscope buffer size follows.  Any "MI" switch
                    also enables COMscope extentions for the device driver.


               "D"  Precedes a COM default specification

                         Position 1      2     3     4

                                  D      T     R     #
                                  D      T     W     #
                                  D      B     #
                                  D      F     1     #
                                  D      F     2     #
                                  D      F     3     #
                                  D      L     #

                                  D      I

               "T"  Precedes an extension mask for this logical device.

               NOTE:     No white space or delimiters are required or allowed
                         within a logical device specific switch as described
                         above.

          An "I" following a "/" will indicate a global interrupt level
          definition follows.  The number following the "I" tells the device
          driver the logical device number to start applying the interrupt
          level definition to.  A delimiter ("-", ",", or single space) and a
          number follow.  The number is to indicate the desired interrupt
          level to use for all of the devices from the specified starting
          logical device to logical device number eight.  Again, all interrupt
          levels except 0 and 1 can be selected.

          A "P" following the "/" indicates a global starting consecutive port
          base address follows.  The number following the "P" tells the driver
          the logical device number to start applying the starting consecutive
          base address to.  A delimiter ("-", ",", or single space) and a
          number to indicate the I/O base address to apply to the starting
          logical device follow.  All succeeding ports (up to and including
          logical device eight) are then given base addresses by adding eight
          to the base address applied to the previous port.

          An "M" following the "/" indicates a global buffer size
          specification follows.  Either an "R" (for Read), a "W" (for Write),
          or an "I" (for COMscope) following the "M" will indicate which
          buffer the global switch refers to.  Immediately following either
          the "R", "W", or "I" is a number to indicate starting logical device
          number to apply the global buffer specification to.  After a
          delimiter ("-", ",", or single space) a number to indicate the
          requested size of the specified buffer follows.    "MI" also enables
          the COMscope extentions for the device driver.  If no number follows
          the "MI" switch a default buffer size of 64 bytes will be allocated.

          A "D" following the "/" indicates a global COM default specification
          follows.  A "T" (for Tmeout), a "B" (for Baud rate),  an "F" (for
          DCB Flag), an "L" (for Line characteristics), or an "I" (for IBM
          defaults) is to follow the "D".  A "T" will be followed by either an
          "R" (for  Read) or a "W" (for Write).  An "F" will be followed by a
          number from 1 to 3 to indicate the DCB flag to set defaults for (see
          the "Physical Device Driver Technical Reference", Category 1, I/O
          control function 53h for a description of these flags).  An "I"
          following the "D" will cause that logical port to use the defaults
          suggested by IBM for Asynchronous device support for that logical
          port.  A number after the "R" or "W" after "T", the "B", the flag


          number, or the "L" tells the device driver the logical device number
          to start applying the default specification to.  After a delimiter
          ("-", ",", or single space) the second number will represent the
          value to set the default to.

          the value will represent the default value to set the flag to.

          "T" following the "/" indicates that a Device Driver extension mask
          follows.  The number following the "T" tells the device driver the


          logical device number to start applying the extension mask to.
          After a delimiter ("-", ",", or single space) the second number will
          enable certain extensions as described below:



                Bit  Function


                0    reserved (must be zero).
                1    Disable Modem Interrupts (Modem Signals will still work)
                2    reserved (must be zero).
                3    reserved (must be zero).
                4    Disable initialization hardware tests.

                8    reserved (must be zero).
                9    reserved (must be zero).
                10   Enable access to OUT1 and LOOP modem control bits.
                11   Use requested baud rate as explicit UART clock divisor.

                12   reserved (must be zero).
                13   reserved (must be zero).
                14   reserved (must be zero).
                15   Print System Location Information at initialization.


          A "C" following the "/" indicates a DOS COMx port range map follows.
          The number following the "C" tells the driver the DOS port number to
          start mapping the device driver's logical ports to.  After a
          delimiter ("-", ",", or single space) the second number indicates
          the last DOS port number to be handled by the COM/8 device driver.
          Up to eight devices can be supported by the COM/8 device driver for
          each COM/8 "DEVICE=" line in the CONFIG.SYS file.  DOS COMx port
          numbering will be consecutive, starting with the first number
          indicated and ending with the second number indicated.

          The COM/8 device driver command line interface is NOT case sensitive
          ("i" = "I").  Any numerical value can be in either base 10 or base
          16 (hexidecimal).  An "H" must directly follow a base 16 number
          (e.g. 3f8h).  All switches for the device driver being loaded must
          be on the same line as the COM/8 "DEVICE=" in the config.sys file.

          Once a particular configuration parameter for a logical device has
          been specified by some command line switch, a following conflicting
          global parameter specification switch will be ignored.  This is
          useful if you want to specify two or more, different base I/O
          address sequences, or interrupt levels, globally.  Just specify the
          global switch for the higher logical port numbers first.  The last
          port specific parameter specification will always override any
          global or previous port specific specification.  We are just
          specifically specifying some particular specificity about very
          specific items, globally speaking (writing) that is, in case you
          hadn't noticed.  You may ignore that last sentence, if you can.  It
          was getting late.

          Configuration Example:


               /VD100 /1p2000hi4mw800hb4800 /2F343hL03TR9B38400 /i2-10 /p2-
               380h /C2-6 /T1-8000h /b3-2400 /DI1

          This example tells the device driver to:

               1.   /VD100 - Be verbose and delay ten seconds after writing
                    initialization and version messages to the screen and
                    initializing all ports to be supported by this device
                    driver load.

               2.   /1p2000hi4mw800hb4800 - Assign to logical device one a
                    base I/O address of 2000h, interrupt level four, set write
                    buffer length to 2048 bytes, and to set its baud rate to
                    4800 bps.

               3.   /2F343hL03TR10B38400 - Assign to logical device two a DCB
                    flag3 enabling both transmit and receive Xon/Xoff flow
                    control (handshaking) with full duplex on, Line
                    characteristics of 8 data bits, one stop bit, and no
                    parity, a read timeout of 100 milliseconds, and a baud
                    rate of 38400 bps.

               4.   /i2-10 - Use interrupt level ten for all logical devices
                    from two through eight.

               5.   /p2-380h - Use base address 380h for logical device two,
                    388h for logical device three, 390h for logical device
                    four, 398h for logical device five, 3A0h for logical
                    device six, 3A8h for logical device seven, and 3B0h for
                    logical device eight.

               6.   /C2-6 - Map COM2 to logical port one, COM3 to logical port
                    two, COM4 to logical port three, COM5 to logical port
                    four, and COM6 to logical port five.  The "C" switch
                    defines and limits the range of DOS COMx ports handled by
                    the device driver load module.

               7.   /T1-8000h, bit 15 - Print device driver memory location at
                    initialization.

               8.   /b3-2400 - Assign to logical devices 3 through 8 a default
                    baud rate of 2400 bps.

               10.  /di1 - Assing to all logical devices the defaults
                    suggested by IBM in the "Physical Device Driver Technical
                    Reference" for Asynchronous communications devices.  NOTE:
                    those parameters previously will not be changed,  only
                    those that have not been assigned will be set to the IBM
                    defaults.

          The maximum buffer space for each device driver load module is about
          63k bytes, total.  You must divide the available space to suit your
          needs.    The default receive buffer size is 2048 bytes and the
          default write buffer size is 256 bytes.  The minimum buffer size is
          128 bytes.

          Using the COM/8 command line switches will override any automatic
          configuration expectations.  A switch specified interrupt level will
          take affect in any case, as will explicit buffer sizes.  A port
          specific switch will always override a global switch.


          If left alone (no command line switches to the contrary), the
          defaults for the COM/8 device driver are:


             Parameter                       Default Values

             Read timeout                    normal, 100 milliseconds
             Write timeout                   normal, 1 second
             Line characteristics            8 data, no parity, 1 stop
             RTS                             enabled  (no handshaking)
             DTR                             enabled  (no Handshaking)
             CTS                             ignored
             DSR                             ignored

             DCD                             ignored
             FIFOs                           automatic (if present)
             Xon/Xoff, transmit and receive  disabled (no handshaking)

          All other parameters are as suggested by IBM.  Default baud rates
          from 2 to 57600 bps can be specified on the COM/8 device driver
          command line.

          If you specify a base I/O address of FFFFh (65535) for a logical
          device, the logical device number and the DOS COMx device name
          mapped to that port will not be accessed or controlled by this
          device driver load, and therefore, may not be accessible to
          applications.

          If you enable System Location Information (bit 15 of the "T" switch)
          you will see a message like the following at the end of all other
          information printed at initialization.

               0309:2230 - 3680 C
               0319:0380 - 0482 - 3662 D

          The first line of the above System Location messages indicates that
          the code segment selector is 0309h (CS), that the run-time code
          segment limit is 2230h (CSLIM), and that the initialization-time
          code segment limit is 3680h (CSLIM).  The second line indicates that
          the data segment selector is 0319h (DS and/or ES), that the run-time
          driver variable area length is 0380h, that the initialization-time
          driver variable area length is 0482h, and that the run-time data
          segment limit is 3662h (DSLIM and/or ESLIM).

          It is recommended that you use the Verbose-Delay (e.g. /VD100)
          switch to give you time to read and/or copy the System Location
          information.

      Application Interface

          The application interface for all ports under COM/8 control is
          exactly the same as for the COM02.SYS, or COM01.SYS device drivers
          supplied with OS/2 1.x and the COM.SYS device driver supplied with
          OS/2 2.0.  You must issue a DosOpen and use the handle returned by
          that function to issue DosWrite, DosRead, and DosDevIOCtl requests.
          See the OS/2 "Physical Device Driver Technical Reference"
          publications under "DosDevIOCtl" for details on using I/O control
          functions for the COM/8 device driver.  The standard and OEM custom
          device drivers support all of the features described in OS/2
          technical publications for Asynchronous Serial devices (Category 1).


          All versions of the COM/8 device driver are designed to operate the
          same as the COM02.SYS and COM01.SYS device drivers supplied with
          OS/2 1.x and the COM.SYS devices driver supplied with OS/2 2.0, with
          a few exceptions:

               1.   DOS COMx device name is based solely on base I/O address
                    and/or explicit command line switches.

               2.   Up to eight COMx devices are supported for each COM/8
                    "DEVICE=" line in your CONFIG.SYS file.

               3.   Up to thirteen different hardware interrupt levels are
                    supported.

               4.   Baud rates up to 115.2k, and above, if hardware is
                    capable.

               5.   The default receive trigger level on ports with 16550A
                    UARTs is 14 bytes.

               6.   Ports can be accessed from a DOS window only through the
                    DOS INT 21h file system interface.

               7.   The MODE command will only work with COM1 through COM9.
                    This is a limitation of the current MODE command
                    asynchronous port support supplied with OS/2.  Use
                    COMscope or command line switches to set COM ports above
                    COM9.

               8.   The device I/O control functions 43h and 63h can be used
                    to set and query baud rates above 57.6K.  This is also
                    possible with the COM.SYS device driver supplied with OS/2
                    2.0.

          Evaluation Device Driver Restrictions

               The COMDDE.SYS device driver has been partially disabled.  When
               the device driver is first initialized at start-up, only 1000
               DosWrite requests will be processed before write capabilities
               will be disabled.  Once write capabilities have been disabled
               they can be restarted again by first closing the port (issuing
               a first level DosClose request), then re-opening the port
               (issuing a first level DosOpen request).  Each re-open will
               then allow half the number of write requests as the previous
               close/open sequence allowed, until no write requests, at all,
               are allowed.  At this time all DosRead requests will be denied
               also.  You will then have to re-boot your system to re-
               initialize the device driver.

     COMscope Communications Monitor

          In order to use the COMscope Communications Monitor, you must
          include at least one "MI" switch on the device driver command line.
          Just add something like "/MI1-256" or "/1MI100h" to the COM/8
          "DEVICE=" line in your CONFIG.SYS file to enable support for
          COMscope.EXE.  In addition the COM/8 device driver must have a lower
          case "m" in its Revision number, as displayed at system
          initialization, for COMscope to work with it (e.g. Revision Sm).


          Setting the "MI" option will allow COMscope to non-invasively
          monitor the data stream and states of the device driver and hardware
          for any, or all, of the devices controlled by the COM/8 device
          driver.

          When you select the Device Driver Status option, under the Monitor
          menu heading, a movable window will be placed on screen that
          displays the various status words available from the device driver.
          If you click the mouse pointer on any of the values displayed,
          another window will open.  That window will list the meanings of
          each bit in the status word and show their states at the time the
          mouse was clicked.

          Unless you enable the Stream Monitor Function from the "Monitor"
          menu, any key pressed while the main window is active will be sent
          to the device driver via the Transmit Byte Immediate I/O control
          function (0x44h).

          You can have an application that accesses a COM port, and COMscope,
          monitoring that same port simultaneously.  COMscope can be loaded
          multiple times to monitor multiple COM ports.

          If you select "Count Characters" from the "Options" menu you can
          calculate the number of character positions from the position of the
          click of the left mouse button to the position of the click of the
          right mouse button.

          The monitor display consists of alternate white on black and black
          on white lines.  When a character is read from the device hardware
          it will be displayed in the white on black line (odd lines).  When a
          character is written to the device hardware it will be displayed in
          the black on white line (even lines).

          The data stream collected by COMscope is continually written to the
          display buffer as characters are sent to and received from the
          device hardware.  When the display buffer is full the data stream
          will wrap around to the beginning of the buffer.  The display buffer
          can hold around 15,000 characters.

          The size of the buffer specified on the device driver command line
          should be selected according to the baud rate at which you expect to
          operate the device.  A buffer size of 256 (e.g. /1MI100h) may be too
          small for 9600 baud; and that's all the help you get.

          The bottom line of the display window will display COMscope errors
          when "Error Display" is selected from the "Options" menu (assuming
          there are errors to display).  Selecting "Count Characters from the
          "Options" menu lets you count characters in the display buffer.
          When neither the "Count Characters" or the "Error Display" items are
          enabled, the bottom line will display the position in the display
          buffer of the top of the window (TOW) and the current position (CUR)
          of the next character to be written to the display buffer.  An up or
          down arrow will show the relative position of those two lines, and a
          block will be displayed whenever the next character to be written
          line is within the COMscope display window.

          COMscope monitors the character stream between the hardware and the
          device driver.  We have another product that can be used to monitor
          the data stream between two different serial ports.


          The version of the COMscope Monitor that will work with the
          evaluation version of the device driver is supplied as MIRROR.EXE
          when it is necessary to supply COMscope version for both the
          evaluation and normal versions of the device driver.  The version of
          COMscope for the evaluation version of the COM/8 device driver can
          be distributed freely, along with the evauation version of the
          device driver itself.
