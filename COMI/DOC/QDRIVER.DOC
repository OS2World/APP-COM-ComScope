                         COM/8 Asynchronous Device Driver
                 Support for Quatech Incorporated Adapter Boards

     Installation

          There is no automatic installation program for the QCOMDD.SYS
          device driver supplied by Quatech.  You can use the method
          described in DDRIVER.DOC for the Custom and Evaluation versions of
          the device driver.

     MCA Adapter Configuration

          When configuring Quatech MCA adapter boards you must select the
          "Scratchpad" option and NOT the "Interrupt Status" option for each
          adapter board to be accessed by the QCOMDD.SYS device driver.  If
          you select the "Interrupt Status" option the devices on that
          adapter board will not be recognized as valid serial devices.  See
          Quatech documentation for an explanation of "Scratchpad" versus
          "Interrupt Status".

          If you want to use the QCOMDD.SYS device driver for non-Quatech
          serial ports you must have at least one Quatech Asynchronous Serial
          adapter board installed in any slot in your machine.

     ISA Adapter Configuration

          If you have Quatech ES-100 (eight port), or QS-100 (four port)
          asynchronous adapter boards, you will be able to take advantage of
          some Quatech specific features built into the QCOMDD.SYS device
          driver.

          These features include:

               1.   The capability of using more than one adapter board (QS-
                    100) on a single interrupt level, spanning multiple
                    slots.

               2.   Defining interrupt identification registers for each
                    installed adapter board, therefore giving more dependable
                    and less error prone operation in the ISA edge sensitive
                    interrupt environment.

               3.   Access to different baud rate ranges, by changing the
                    baud rate clock jumpers on the adapter boards and using
                    the explicit baud rate divisor feature of the QCOMDD.SYS
                    device driver (bit 11 of the "T" extension mask switch).

          There is one additional command line switch and one additional bit
          definition for the "T" extension mask switch that will allow you to
          take advantage of Quatech ISA adapter features.

          An "S" following a "/" on the "DEVICE=QCOMDD.SYS" command line
          indicates to the device driver that an Interrupt Identification
          Register address specification follows.  The number following the
          "S" tells the device driver an I/O address at which to expect an
          interrupt identification register.  Up to four "S" switches will be
          recognized and each switch indicates an interrupt identification
          register for one installed adapter board.



          The "S" switch is to be used in conjunction with bit 14 of the "T"
          extension mask switch.  Bit 14 of the extension mask must be set to
          enable the Quatech Specific features of the QCOMDD.SYS device
          driver.  See extension mask explanation under Device Driver
          Configuration in DDRIVER.DOC.

          There is one other Quatech specific switch.  The "s" switch is to
          be used when you want to use the QCOMDD.SYS device driver with
          non-Quatech Asynchronous Serial ports.  A "number" is to follow the
          "s".  The "number" represents the DOS COMx port number of the first
          QCOMDD.SYS DOS COMx device "connected" to a Quatech adapter board
          port.

          The "S" switch and the "s" switch are, of course, case sensitive.

          To take advantage of features 1 and 2 (above) you must set bit 14
          of the extension mask switch for all Quatech ports to be supported
          (i.e. with a global "T" switch) and specify an interrupt
          identification register (with the "S" switch) for each Quatech
          adapter board to be supported.  You must also configure your
          Quatech adapter boards for the "Interrupt Status" option and NOT
          the "Scratchpad" option.  See Quatech documentation for details on
          how to configure your adapter boards for the "Interrupt Status"
          option.  When taking advantage of these features the device driver
          can support only one interrupt level for each "DEVICE=QCOMDD.SYS"
          line in your CONFIG.SYS file.

          If you want to use the QCOMDD.SYS device driver for non-Quatech
          serial ports you must:

               1.   Have at least one Quatech adapter board installed in your
                    machine.

               2.   Position the "DEVICE=QCOMDD.SYS" line to be "connected"
                    to the Quatech adapter(s) before any "DEVICE=QCOMDD.SYS"
                    line to be "connected" to a non-Quatech serial port in
                    your CONFIG.SYS file.

               3.   Use the "s" command line switch in any non-Quatech
                    "DEVICE=QCOMDD.SYS" "connections" to indicate the DOS
                    COMx port number of the first "connected" Quatech serial
                    port.

          Example:

          DEVICE=QCOMDD.SYS /i1-10 /p1-380h /C3-6 /T1-4000h /S387h

          DEVICE=QCOMDD.SYS /c1-2 /1i4p3f8h /2i3p2f8h /s3

          The first line tells the first device driver load to:

               1.   /i1-10 - Use interrupt level ten for all logical devices
                    from one through eight.

               2.   /p1-380h - Use base address 380h for logical device one,
                    388h for logical device two, 390h for logical device
                    three, 398h for logical device four, 3A0h for logical
                    device five, 3A8h for logical device six, 3B0h for
                    logical device seven, and 3B8h for logical device eight.



               3.   /C3-6 - Map COM3 to logical port one, COM4 to logical
                    port two, COM5 to logical port three, COM6 to logical
                    port four.  The device driver will not try to initialize
                    any logical port above four.

               4.   /T1-4000h, bit 14 - Enable Quatech feature support for
                    logical ports one through eight.

               5.   /S387h - Expect an interrupt identification register at
                    I/O address 387h.

          The second line tells the second device driver load to:

               1.   /C1-2 - Map COM1 to logical port one, COM2 to logical
                    port two.  The device driver will not try to initialize
                    any logical port above two.

               2.   /1i4p3f8h - Assign to logical device one a base I/O
                    address of 3f8h and interrupt level four.

               3.   /2i3p2f8h - Assign to logical device two a base I/O
                    address of 2f8h and interrupt level three.

               4.   /s3 - Look to COM3 for verification of Quatech adapter
                    presence.  If COM3 had not been successfully "connected"
                    by a previous QCOMDD.SYS device driver load, then this
                    load will fail.

          The first line of the preceding example could be used to "connect"
          a Quatech QS-100 (four port) adapter board.  The values 387h, 38fh,
          397h, or 39fh would all be valid interrupt identification register
          definitions for this assumed configuration of a QS-100.  Only one
          "S" switch register definition for each Quatech adapter board can
          and should be used.

          If you are using the evaluation version of the device driver
          (COMDDE.SYS) you cannot configure the adaptor board for the
          "Interrupt Status" option unless you turn on bit 14 of the
          extension mask command line option ("T" switch).  You must specify
          at least one interrupt identification register address ("S" switch)
          if you configure your Quatech adapter for "Interrupt Status".  The
          presence of a Quatech adapter board is not required when using the
          evaluation version of the COM/8 device driver, and therefore, the
          "s" switch will have no effect.

          The Quatech supplied version of the COM/8 device driver will not
          work with the Quatech DS-100 adapter boards as there is no
          interrupt ID register on these boards.  You must purchase another
          version of the COM/8 device driver directly from OS/tools for use
          on Quatech DS-100 adapters.
