OS/tools Incorporated:
       COMi Asynchronous Serial Device Driver (DEMO)
       Version 3.71 E

What's New:

        1.  Support for 16650 and 16750 UARTs has been added.
        2.  Support for new COMscope features.
        

COMi Description:

        COMi is a multi-port asynchronous serial device driver for OS/2.  It 
        allows access to COM1 through COM99 in any OS/2 machine.  COMi supports
        shared interrupts on Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) machines when 
        used with specific serial adapters, and on Micro Channel Architecture
        (MCA) machines with any serial adapter.  COMi is designed to conform
        exactly to the Application Programming Interface as defined for 
        Category One, Asynchronous Serial Device Drivers in the "Physical
        Device Driver" technical reference.

Features:
        1.  Up to sixteen devices on a single hardware interrupt are supported 
             on ISA machines.
        2.  Allows user to specify all device driver buffer sizes.
        3.  Serial devices from COM1 through COM99 are supported.
        4.  Tests each device and interrupt connection at initialization. 
        5.  Supports baud rates of 115.2k and above.
        6.  Lets user specify the start-up states of all protocol parameters.
        7.  Enables applications to control the OUT1 and LOOP modem control
             signals.
        8.  Includes extensions for COMscope access.

NOTE:
       This version of COMi limits the number of write requests.  After 1000 
       write requests to the device driver will stop transmitting and 
       begins returning a "bytes written" count of zero.

COMi requires OS/2 2.0 or later.
