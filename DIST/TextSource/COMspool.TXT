       COMspool Serial Device PMSPOOL interface
       Version 2.10

       COMi Asynchronous Serial Device Driver (DEMO)
       Version 3.71 E
        
COMspool Description:

        COMspool takes advantage of the COMi device driver to allow more than 
        the four serial printer connections provided with OS/2.  COMspool works 
        seamlessly with PMSPOOL to provide the same user interface to
        serial print spooler installation and configuration.

Features:

        Takes advanatage of all the features of the COMi device driver 
        including:

        1.  Up to sixteen serial devices on a single hardware interrupt on ISA
            machines.
        2.  Device driver buffer sizes are user definable.
        3.  Serial devices from COM1 through COM99.
        4.  Support for 16650 and 16750 UARTs.
        5.  Baud rates of 460.8k BPS and above.

NOTE:
       The version of COMi supplied with this version of COMspool limits the 
       number of write requests.  After 1000 write requests the device driver
       will stop transmitting and begins returning a "bytes written" count of
       zero.

COMspool requires OS/2 2.0 or later.
