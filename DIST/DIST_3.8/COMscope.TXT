COMscope Description:

        COMscope is a Presentation Manager program that allows monitoring and 
        control of OS/2 COM devices, without interfering with any application 
        accessing any device being monitored.  COMscope can take the place of a
        stand alone protocol analyzer to aid in troubleshooting communications
        sessions and to help debug communications applications.

        COMscope takes advantage of extensions to the COMi device driver to 
        allow a user to have complete control of communications devices and 
        processes on their OS/2 machines.

COMscope Device Monitoring and Display Capabilities:

	Captures/traces the serial stream as written to, and read from, the 
	hardware, by any communications application accessing the port.  There are
  two display modes:  Lexical and Time-relational.

	Displays device driver transmit and receive buffer utilization by displaying
  the number of characters currently in a buffer and the ratio of content to
  size (in percent).

	Displays all modem input signal states; CTS, DTR, CD, and RI.

	Displays modem output signal states; RTS and DTR, as set by an application,
	the COMi device driver, and/or COMscope.

	Displays the "COM Event" word, as seen by an application.  The "COM Event"
  word is normally cleared whenever an application reads its contents. COMscope
  gives you the choice of either clearing the device driver variable or leaving
  it for an application to read and clear.

	Displays the "COM Error" word, as seen by an application.  As with the "COM
	Event" word, the user can choose to clear, or not clear, this device driver
  variable, as a query by an application would.

	Displays the "COM status" byte, as seen by an application.

  Displays the "Transmit Status" byte, as seen by an application.

	Displays the current device and device driver setup, as selected by an
	application accessing a device, or by COMscope.

	Displays the current configuration and startup defaults for all devices
	controlled by COMi.

COMscope Device Control Capabilities:

	Sets all device driver parameters an application is able to set; including
  baud rate, line characteristics, read/write time-out processing, handshaking,
  stream filters, and FIFO function.

	Can cause the receive and/or transmit device driver buffers to be flushed.

	Is able to place the UART into the break state, and return it to normal.

	Can force the defined Xoff or Xon characters to be transmitted on command.

	Is able to force the device driver to act like an Xoff, or Xon, has been
	received.

	Will transmit any keystroke, or bit pattern as requested.

	Controls all of the UART's output signals; including DSR, RTS, OUT1, and LOOP.

	COMscope can be used to install and configure any COMi device.

NOTE:   The version of COMi that is supplied with this version of COMscope
        limits the number of write requests.  After 1000 write requests to the
        device driver will stop transmitting and begins returning a "bytes
        written" count of zero.
        
Sample "C" source code for Category One, Asynchronous Serial Devices,
DosDevIOCtl functions is included.  .

A program named SPLIT.EXE is also included.  SPLIT will remove the tracking 
fields from a COMscope captured stream file and create files that contain only
the characters received, or characters transmitted for the captured stream. 
"C" source code for SPLIT is also supplied.

COMscope requires OS/2 2.0 or later.
